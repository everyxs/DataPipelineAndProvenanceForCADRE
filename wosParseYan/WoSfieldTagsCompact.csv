In this context, it becomes an important topic in the data mining field that how to effectively construct an efficient knowledge discovery and mining model. Ensemble learning, as one research hot spot, aims to integrate data fusion, data modeling, and data mining into a unified framework. Specifically, ensemble learning firstly extracts a set of features with a variety of transformations. Based on these learned features, multiple learning algorithms are utilized to produce weak predictive results. Finally, ensemble learning fuses the informative knowledge from the above results obtained to achieve knowledge discovery and better predictive performance via voting schemes in an adaptive way. In this paper, we review the research progress of the mainstream approaches of ensemble learning and classify them based on different characteristics. In addition, we present challenges and possible research directions for each mainstream approach of ensemble learning, and we also give an extra introduction for the combination of ensemble learning with other machine learning hot spots such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.","[Dong, Xibin; Yu, Zhiwen; Shi, Yifan; Ma, Qianli] South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Cao, Wenming] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China","Yu, ZW (reprint author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [61722205, 61751205, 61572199, 61502174, 61872148, U1611461]; key research and development program of Guangdong province of China [2018B010107002]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2016A050503015, 2017A030313355]; Guangzhou science and technology planning project [201704030051]","The authors are grateful for the constructive advice received from the anonymous reviewers of this paper.

In the existing literatures on complex dynamical networks, the emphasizes is synchronization or stabilization of nodes, the dynamic behaviors of the links between nodes are always ignored. It is noted that the state of links is very important to the networks in practical, such as, the tension value of webs in web-winding system, the relationships between individuals in social network, therefore, discussing the tracking control problem for links subsystem is also of practical significance. Considering the state of links is difficult to be measured accurately in practice applications, this makes it difficult to design the controller. In view of this, a state observer is proposed for the links subsystem modeled mathematically by the Riccati matrix difference equation in this paper. And then the control scheme is proposed for the links subsystem by employing the state observer such that the links subsystem asymptotically converging to the given target. Finally, the simulations are used to show the validity of the method in this paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The nonlinear system is composed of several arbitrarily switched complex nonlinear subsystems, and the nonlinear system does not satisfy the so-called hypothesis of the global Lipschitz-like condition. First an uniform nonlinear decoupling method for switched subsystems is proposed to overcome the double uncertainty from the complex nonlinear structure and arbitrarily switching. Next a states backstepping controller is designed to realize exponentially stability of the switched nonlinear systems. Then based on an uniform gain observer with the uncertainty of the subsystem nonlinearity, an output backstepping controller is construct to realize exponentially stability of the observer-backstepping feedback control system. Two detailed simulations are finally presented to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This problem has motivated considerable interest from expert systems research to develop accurate early-warning applications and the breakthroughs in deep learning in complex visual understanding tasks open novel research opportunities. However, despite the improvements in performance demonstrated in the current literature, a comprehensive study of the challenges and limitations of this approach is still a gap in the state-of-the-art. To address this issue, the contributions of this work are threefold. First, we overview recent works to identify common difficulties and shortcomings of these approaches, and assess issues related to the quality of the databases. Second, to overcome data limitations, this work proposes a transfer learning approach coupled with data augmentation techniques tested under a tenfold cross-validation scheme. The proposed framework enables leveraging an open-source dataset featuring images from more than 35 real fire events, which unlike video-based works offers higher variability between samples, allowing evaluating the approach in an extensive set of real scenarios. Third, this article presents an in-depth study of the limitations, providing a comprehensive analysis of the patterns causing misclassifications. The key insights gained in this analysis provide relevant takeaways to guide future research towards the implementation of expert systems in decision support systems in firefighting and civil protection operations.
